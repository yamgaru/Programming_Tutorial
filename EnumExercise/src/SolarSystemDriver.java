	 * JUPITER (1.9e+27, 7.1492e7), SATURN (5.688e+26, 6.0268e7),
	 * URANUS (8.686e+25, 2.5559e7), NEPTUNE (1.024e+26, 2.4746e7);
	 * 
	 * There should also be a constant for gravity:
	 * g = 6.67300E-11;
	 * 
	 * Write getter methods for mass and radius. Also write functions
	 * to compute the gravity
	 * Gravity = gravityconstant*mass/radius^2
	 * and the weight
	 * Weiht = mass*gravity
	 * 
	 * Print all the planets in this class and don't forget to test
	 * your methods
