public class Pair {
	//todo: In Java it is not possible to have two return values. Luckily you can use Generics to solve that problem.
	//Change this class to a Generic where you can have a pair of two Variables even with different data types.
	//Write a constructor for this class to set those values and also getter and setter methods to retrieve them and
	//test your Methods in a driver-class
}
