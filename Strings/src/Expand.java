		//todo: take as an input a combination of characters and numbers (e.g. 2a3b5c)
		//expand the String by printing each letter so many times as the number before the letter indicates
		//e.g. 2a3b5c -> aabbbccccc
		//Hint: first start with inputs where there is always a number and then a character, then think about how
		//to improve your code such that you can use values greater or equal 10, eg. 10a13b22c
		//Further modification: if a character should only be printed one time you don't need to write any number infront of that character
		//e.g. a3b12cd5e -> abbbccccccccccccdeeeee
